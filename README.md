# Arneniya
Arneniya is an adventure pseudo-RPG where a player can travel around a map and go to different areas to answer questions of varying difficulty, all while running away from an evil ghost. Players receive an increment in their score when they answer a question correctly, and they lose the game when they either collide with the ghost or answer a question incorrectly. The game features a total of five scenes with a relatively large pool of questions to answer from. As long as they are formatted correctly, these questions can be imported by the player. Randomized environment logic is used to create a variety of scenes in tandem with random questions to create a unique experience each time the game is played.
