Instructions for movement and interaction with the game are listed at the top of the screen when playing, but basic instructions for the latter are listed below.

To move, use the arrow keys on the keyboard. There are certain tiles, such as trees, that you may not walk through.

To enter indicated buildings, press the "E" key. This is where you will be asked questions.

To answer riddles, press the indicated keys (i.e., "A") to choose an answer.

When a question is asked, you may not move around until you answer the question. If you attempt to use the arrow keys to move around, you will no longer be able to answer the question and you must press 'Q' to exit the room and re-enter to reinitiate the process.

At any time, if you wish to leave a room, press the 'Q' key.

You are free to enter and exit buildings as you please.

You are being followed by a smart ghost. Avoid the ghost at all costs and answer as many questions correctly as you can by entering the 4 buildings around the perimeter of the map. If you step within one tile of the ghost, the game will end and you will lose.

Each time you enter a building, you will be met with a new and more challenging question, ranging from easy to intermediate to hard. Each time you get one of these questions correct, a point is added to your score. If you answer a question incorrectly, the game will end and you will lose.

Feel free to import your own questions by modifying the questionPool variable at the very beginning of the game. Questions must be formatted as such:

'Easy Question: What is the capital of France?', 'a: Madrid', 'b: Rome', 'c: Paris', 'c';
where the 'c' at the end represents the letter of the correct option.


Play with your friends and see who can get the highest score before losing!
